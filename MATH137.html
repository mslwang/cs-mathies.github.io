        <h2>From LEARN:</h2>
        <div>The MATH 137 final exam is coming up on Thursday, December 12th at 9:00am.</div>
        <div><br/>No aids allowed (no calculators).&#160; Also, no formula sheet will be provided.</div>
        <div></div>
        <div><strong>COVERAGE:</strong><br/>The final covers everything from assignments/quizzes 1-10, Assignment MT, and Assignment on Ch. 5.&#160; This includes chapters 1 - 5 of the course notes.</div>
        <div>NOTE that section 1.5 (Series), section 3.14 (related rates) and section 5.3 (Big O) are NOT covered on the final.&#160; You will not be asked to classify a discontinuity (section 2.8.1), but you may be asked about continuity/discontinuity.&#160; You will not be asked to compute a limit using Taylor&#39;s Approximation Theorem 1 explicitly, though you may use it if you wish.</div>
        <div><br/>You do not need to memorize proofs of the major theorems for the exam.&#160; You may need to STATE and USE a theorem/definition from the course notes, but not prove it.&#160; The exam does contain other proofs though.</div>
        <div><strong>&#160;</strong></div>
        <div><strong>SEATING:</strong><br/>To see your room and seat, check:<br/><a rel="noopener" href="https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule" target="_blank">https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/<wbr/>teaching/schedule</a></div>
        <div></div>
        <div><strong>PRACTICE:<br/></strong>The best things to study are the assignments, the quizzes, the practice midterm, actual midterm, and practice final exams.&#160; Most problems on your final are similar (and in some cases, even the same) as questions that appear on these.&#160; Solutions to the practice exams are coming on Friday.</div>
        <div></div>
        <div>The Practice Final will have the same instructions as your final and the multiple choice/true false are set up the same way as the quizzes, with the last page containing a bubble sheet you must fill out.</div>
        <div><br/><strong>BREAKDOWN:</strong><br/>The exam is 150 minutes long (2.5 hours), and approximately the length of 5 quizzes.&#160; There are:<br/>5 multiple choice questions (material from all parts of the course)<br/>5 True/False questions (material from all parts of the course)<br/>5 short answer questions (material from all parts of the course)<br/>13 long answer questions (some with more than one part):<br/>Questions 1 - 3: Pre-midterm content (Chapters 1, 2).</div>
        <div>Questions 4 - 6: Chapter 3 material (Derivatives).<br/>Question 7 - 10: Chapter 4 material (MVT and its applications).</div>
        <div>Question 11 &amp; 12: Section 5.1 and 5.2 material (Taylor polynomials and Taylor&#39;s Theorem).</div>
        <div>Question 13: Curve Sketching (it follows the same template that has been posted).</div>
        <div>&#160;&#160;</div>
