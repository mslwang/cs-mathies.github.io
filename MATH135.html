        <h2>From LEARN:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The final exam is on&nbsp;<strong>Tuesday</strong><strong>, December 10, 2019 from 9:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.</strong></li>
            <li>You&nbsp;<strong>must write the exam in your assigned seat</strong>&nbsp;unless you have already arranged to write through AccessAbility Services.</li>
            <li>The exam covers material up to and including polynomials. This corresponds to&nbsp;<strong>Chapters 1 to 11 in the course notes</strong>&nbsp;and all the assignments.</li>
            <li>The exam is heavily weighted towards post-midterm material, but be aware that these topics build on the foundations of the early weeks of the course. Aside from this, the amount of time spent in class on each topic is usually an approximate indication of its emphasis on the exam.</li>
            <li><strong>Bring your WatCard</strong>&nbsp;to the exam. This is important. Also, you may need to provide your Waterloo student ID number and WaTIAM/Quest Login Userid. (Most likely this information will already be printed on the front page of your assigned exam.)</li>
            <li>This reference sheet listing most of the named propositions in the course notes will be provided with your exam.</li>
            <li>Bring a pen or a dark pencil to write your solutions. Erasers and rulers are permitted but&nbsp;<strong>no calculators or other aids are allowed</strong>.</li>
            <li>To be fair and consistent, proctors will not answer any questions about the course material during the exam.</li>
            <li>You are expected to have read this note before coming to write the exam, and hence it will be assumed that you agree to the terms in this note and will comply with the University of Waterloo examination policies.</li>
            <li>The sample final exam has been posted. The structure of the actual final exam will be very similar to the structure of the sample exam. The solutions to the sample exam will be posted closer to the exam date.</li>
            <li>Do not forget to&nbsp;<strong>read the news here on LEARN at least once a day</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Study by reviewing your notes, the course notes and posted assignment solutions. However,&nbsp;<strong>spend most of your time practicing writing proofs</strong>. Complete all the extra recommended problems posted with the assignments. Try solving assigned problems again (without your notes in front of you). Revisit the midterm exam. Look for exercises in the course notes. Make up your own statements to prove and share them with friends.</li>
            <li>Know your definitions. For example, you must know exactly what&nbsp;<em>divides</em>,&nbsp;<em>gcd</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>polynomial</em>&nbsp;mean. You must be comfortable with all the notation we have introduced.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are familiar with all the propositions listed on the provided reference sheet.</li>
            <li>Don&rsquo;t tire yourself out. Study hard but don&rsquo;t neglect your other courses and make sure you sleep well the night before the exam. Cramming at the last minute is not a good idea.</li>
            <li>Vary the way you study. Spend time reading, writing, talking out loud, and just thinking about the material.</li>
            <li>Arrive at the exam location early. Extra time will not be given to anyone that arrives late. Coming late is stress that you do not want or need to deal with.</li>
            <li>During the exam,
            <ul>
            <li>Read the front page of the exam carefully and listen to any instructions given to you by proctors.</li>
            <li>Read all of the questions before you start writing. Consciously decide which questions you want to answer first. Do not spend too much time on any one question.</li>
            <li>Listen to any instructions given to you by the examiner.</li>
            <li>Write legibly. We cannot grade answers that we cannot read.</li>
            <li>We believe sufficient space is provided to answer all questions but if you need more room, extra pages are provided at the end of the exam.</li>
            <li>Wear a watch.&nbsp; Sometimes the clocks are difficult to see.&nbsp; Please note that smart watches are not permitted.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>After the exam is over, take a break, and be proud of your effort. Don&rsquo;t immediately worry about your results. Focus on your remaining exams and when they are done, enjoy the non-academic part of your life.</li>
